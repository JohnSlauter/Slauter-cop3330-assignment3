Goal: Given a file of first names, last names, and salaries,
      sort the employees by alphabetical order and print out
      the sorted information in a table

     Employee object{

        Has fields for first name, last name, and salary

        Has "getter" methods for variables

     }

     main(){

        Create ArrayList of Employee objects

        Array of 3 ints to store longest word in each section of the table

        Read in data with read_File function and store in Employee ArrayList

        Print output table with get_Output

    }

     read_File(input_file){

        Create ArrayList of Employee objects

        Create new Scanner that reads input_file

        Set Scanner delimiter to be comma and new line character

        Read file with scanner and store in ArrayList

        Close Scanner

        return ArrayList

    }

    find_Longest_Length(ArrayList<Employee>){

        Create int array with length 3

        Find longest first name, last name, and salary in ArrayList and store lengths in int array

        return int array

    }

    get_Output(ArrayList<Employee>, int[3]){

        Format Output

        Return Output

    }
