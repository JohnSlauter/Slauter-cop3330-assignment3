Goal: Create search by name for a json file containing products

      Product object{

        Has fields for String name, double price, and int quantity

        Has "getter" methods

      }

      ProductList object{

        Contains ArrayList of products

        Has "getter" method for ArrayList

      }

      main(){

             Create ArrayList of Product

             Use read_Input function to put products from the json file into the ArrayList

              Create hashmap based on arraylist using create_Product_Map function

              Use search map function

          }

      read_Input(String input_file) {

              Create new BufferedReader object set to read the input file

              Create new Gson object

              Create new ProductList object

              Use Gson object to copy the data from the BufferedReader to the ProductList

              Close the reader

              return the ProductList's ArrayList

          }

      create_Product_Map(ArrayList<Product> product_list){

              Create new hashmap where key is name of the product and value is the product object

              Put every Product object in the ArrayList into hashmap (key = Product object's name, value = Product object)

              return hashmap

          }

      search_Map(HashMap<String, Product> product_map){

              Create new scanner to get input from user

              Ask for search criteria

              Store search criteria

              while(search criteria invalid){

                  Ask again

                  Store the new search criteria

              }

              Retrieve the Product associated with the search criteria and print out information

              Close scanner

          }
