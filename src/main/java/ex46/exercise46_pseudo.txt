Goal: Given a text file, count the frequency at which
      each word in the file appears and print the results
      in a table

     main(){

        Create new hashmap (key is string, value is integer)

        Use count_Words function to set up hashmap

        Create new ArrayList

        Set up ArrayList based on the hashmap by using map_To_ArrayList function

        Sort ArrayList with sort_ArrayList function

        Print information with print_Frequencies function

    }

    HashMap<String, Integer> count_Words(String input_file) {

        Create new hashmap (key is string, value is integer)

        Create new scanner connected to input file

        Go through every word in the file

        if(word is already in hashmap){

            Put word in the hashmap again, but set the value as the previous value associated with the word + 1

        }

        else{

            Put word in hashmap, set associated value to 1

        }

        Return hashmap

    }

    ArrayList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> map_To_ArrayList(HashMap<String, Integer> map){

        Create new ArrayList of Map elements (key is String, value is Integer)

        Store all elements in the hashmap in the ArrayList

        return ArrayList

    }

    ArrayList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> sort_ArrayList(ArrayList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>>){

        Sort ArrayList elements by value (descending) with Selection Sort

        Return sorted ArrayList

    }

    void print_Frequencies(ArrayList<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> list){

        Print out each word in the ArrayList and its associated frequency in a table format

    }
