Goal: Sort a list of names contained in a file alphabetically
      and write the sorted names to a new file

    main{

        Read in names with read_File function

        Alphabetize names with alphabetize_ArrayList function

        Write names to output file using writeToFile function

    }

    read_File(InputFile) {

        Create ArrayList of Strings

        Open new Scanner to input file

        Set Scanner delimiter to be new line character (\n)

        Read in the contents of input file with Scanner and store it in the ArrayList

        Close Scanner

        return ArrayList

    }

    alphabetize_ArrayList(ArrayList<String>){

        Selection sort the ArrayList based by using compareTo method of String objects

        return sorted ArrayList

    }

    write_To_File(ArrayList<String>, output_file) {

        Create new BufferedWriter object that will write to output_file

        Write total number of names

        Write line of dashes

        Write all names in ArrayList, separate with new line
