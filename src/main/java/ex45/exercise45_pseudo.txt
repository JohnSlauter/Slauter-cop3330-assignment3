Goal: Given a text file and a word to replace, replace all instances
      of the word with another specified replacement word

    main(){

            Read input text and place in a string with read_Input function

            Use replace_All function to modify the string with the input text

            Use new scanner to get the output file name from user

            Write contents of the string to output file with write_Output function

            Close scanner

    }

    read_Input(String input_file) {

       Create new scanner that will read input file

       Store contents of input file into a string

       Return string

    }

    replace_All(String text, String to_replace, String replacement){

        Store all the index of all instances of the word that will be replaced
        *The indexes must be stored from last to first

        For each index, set the text to equal the substring before the word + replacement + substring after the word

        Return text

    }

    write_Output(String destination, String text) {

        Create new BufferWriter object that will write to the specified address

        Write the text

        Close writer

    }
